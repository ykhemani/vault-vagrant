# vault-vagrant

This repo stands up a VirtualBox VM using Vagrant that is configured with HashiCorp Vault and other software, as indicated in the [khemani/ubunutu-bionic64-hashistack-enterprise](https://app.vagrantup.com/khemani/boxes/ubuntu-bionic64-hashistack-enterprise/versions/0.0.1) 0.0.1 box.

It delivers a single node HashiCorp Vault cluster configured as follows:
* HSM Seal using SoftHSM
* Integrated (Raft) Storage
* Initialized
* File Audit Device ()
* Raw File Audit Device
* Vault Enterprise License applied, if provided.

## Prerequisites

Download and install the required software if you don't already have it installed.

The instructions below reference the use of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). You can also download and install the software interactively.

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

```
brew install virtualbox
```

2. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

```
brew install vagrant
```

## Usage

1. Set the following environment variables to specify the Vault VM hostname and ip. Optionally, also add an entry for this ip and hostname pair to your `/etc/hosts` file.

```
export vault_hostname_1='vault1.example.com'
export vault_ip_1='192.168.100.21'

sudo sh -c "echo \"${vault_ip_1}  ${vault_hostname_1}\" >> /etc/hosts"
grep ${vault_hostname_1} /etc/hosts
```

2. If you would like to use TLS certificates, set `vault_tls_disable` to false, set `tls_private_key` to the name of the file containing the TLS private key, set `tls_certificate` to the name of the file containg the TLS certificate and, if appropriate, the CA chain, and place these files in the `files` directory. Please be sure that you do NOT check these files into version control (at least not the private key). If the files are named with a `.pem` extension, they will be ignored in the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file.

```
export vault_tls_disable='false'
export tls_private_key='privkey.pem'
export tls_certificate='fullchain.pem'
```

3. If you have a Vault license, specify the body of the license in the `vault_license` environment variable.

```
export vault_license=<license_file_contents>
```

4. Bring up your box!
```
vagrant up
```

5. SSH into your box and examine your Vault cluster
```
vagrant ssh
```

```
vault status
vault secrets list
sudo cat /data/vault/audit/audit.log  | jq -r .
```

6. Open a browser and point it at the `VAULT_ADDR` provided when you brought your box up.

## Sample Output

```
$ export vault_hostname_1='vault1.example.com'

$ export vault_ip_1='192.168.100.21'

$ export vault_tls_disable='false'

$ export tls_private_key='privkey.pem'

$ export tls_certificate='fullchain.pem'

$ sudo sh -c "echo \"${vault_ip_1}  ${vault_hostname_1}\" >> /etc/hosts"

$ grep ${vault_hostname_1} /etc/hosts
192.168.100.21	vault1.example.com
